# HR Dashboard Analysis
## Project Objective
The HR manager wants a comprehensive dashboard to analyze human resources data, providing both summary views for high-level insights and detailed employee records for in-depth analysis.

## Dateset Used

## Summary View

The summary view should be divided into three main sections: Overview, Demographics, and Income Analysis

## Overview

The Overview section should provide a snapshot of the overall HR metrics, including:

•	Display the total number of hired employees, active employees, and terminated employees.

•	Visualize the total number of hired and terminated employees over the years.

•	Present a breakdown of total employees by department and job titles.

•	Compare total employees between headquarters (HQ) and branches (New York is the HQ)

•	Show the distribution of employees by city and state.

## Demographics

The Demographics section should offer insights into the composition of the workforce, including:

•	Present the gender ratio in the company.
•	Visualize the distribution of employees across age groups and education levels.
•	Show the total number of employees within each age group.
•	Show the total number of employees within each education level.
•	Present the correlation between employees’ educational backgrounds and their performance ratings.

## Income

The income analysis section should focus on salary-related metrics, including:

•	Compare salaries across different education levels for both genders to identify any discrepancies or patterns.
•	Present how age correlates with the salary for employees in each department.

## Employee Records View

•	Provide a comprehensive list of all employees with necessary information such as name, department, position, gender, age, education, and salary.
•	Users should be able to filter the list based on any of the available columns.
